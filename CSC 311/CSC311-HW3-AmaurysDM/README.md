## Simple Guessing Game

In this game, you choose between a circle and a square. After making your selection and pressing 'Guess,' an animated shape will appear—either a circle or a square—displayed in red or green. The color indicates whether your guess was correct, adding a visual element to the challenge.

Your guess is also reacorded in a .accdb file. You can clear this file anytime.
You can also press "Show Guess From DB" to display all of your previous guesses.
