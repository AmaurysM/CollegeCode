# CSE218

## Final Project

This was created as the final project for 218.

For this project, we were tasked to make an application like Facebook or Twitter. 

### Features for aplication:

* Login

* Create a new account

* Account information: username, password, all the posts, all the subscribers

* See all the posts by your subscribers in chronological order with the most recent on top

* Add new posts

* Respond to any existing post

* You are able to see all the responses to a particular post with the latest one at the bottom

* You can subscribe to accounts

* Data persistence

#### Notes:

Every student was tasked to create the front end and the back end for their own project. While making it I believed that the individual parts were easy but time-consuming.

For this project, we were allowed to do a lot more if we wanted to. I kept trying to make my existing code either look better or work better, so I quickly ran at a time. This made it impossible to style the webpage how I actually wanted to or add some of the features that I wanted to add.

Too much Waterfall not enough Agile.

## Other Works

My hard drive crashed the semester after I took this class, so all of my other schoolwork has been completely deleted.
